### Commands to run scripts:
- `npm install` - to install all packages
- `npm run start` - to run in dev env 
- `npm run build` - to build prod env
- `npm run test` - to run  tests
- `npm run lint:ts` - to run eslint on ts part
- `npm run format` - to run prettier for format all files in project

### What did/used in this solution

- used typescript
- used react
- used react hooks
- used scss
- implemented responsive design

### Ideas for future development:
- implement more 'pixel' friendly design
